# **Mini Project Two**

In this project our group explored how we can visualize the places used in any news articles.Key techniques used were extracting places names from the text using **regex** and
**gazetteer**. We also applied **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Geocoding** to visualize the places on a map. Following is the oveerview of  main steps taken to complete this project.

## Repository structure

We used a repository containing:
-A folder named "articles' with the news articles.
-A folder named "gazetteer" containing the tsv file with known place names and thier coordinates.
